# Calibration Methods For Fairness
Fairness in Machine Learning and the Evaluation of Calibration Methods.


Fairness is becoming an important topic in machine learning (ML) in the recent years. But why do we care about fairness?
Many aspects of our lives such as happiness, success and well being can be profoundly affected by the decision of others through automated systems, for example whether one is admitted or not to certain school, get the job position, loan, products recommended to us etc. This systems are being used in our day to day lives and is going to be even more used in the near future as more areas are integrating ML in their processes or products. Thus fairness is highly related to our own benefits.
